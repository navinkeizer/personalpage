I am a Ph.D. student, passionate about future networking solutions like Web3, Blockchains, and Edge Computing, at the Institute of Communications and Connected Systems ([ICCS][1]) at UCL. My work has focused on how content delivery and retrieval can be decentralised on Web3 (a range of technologies, which include P2P storage networks and Blockchains, aiming to decentralise the control and governance of the current Web).
